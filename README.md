# Asteroids-Remake
Taking the idea of the classic "Asteroids" game and making a lightweight Unity version of it.

## Note
This is just a project to improve my understanding of Unity. I have not professionalized my code as much as I would like.
All assets were made by me... For better or worse.

## Code usage
Feel free to use my code or assets if you wish. I would appreciate some credit if at all possible, though.

## Git Ignore
I made the mistake of not adding a proper Git Ignore file to this repository. Sorry.
